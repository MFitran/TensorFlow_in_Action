    "# Chapter 10: Natural language processing with TensorFlow: Language modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook reproduces the code and summarizes the theoretical concepts from Chapter 10 of *'TensorFlow in Action'* by Thushan Ganegedara.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter focuses on **language modeling**—the task of predicting the next token (a word or character) in a sequence. This is a fundamental task in NLP that enables models to generate text.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover:\n",
    "1.  **Data Processing**: How to process a raw text corpus, use n-grams to manage vocabulary size, and build an efficient `tf.data` pipeline.\n",
    "2.  **Model Implementation**: Building a language model using a **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**, which is similar to an LSTM.\n",
    "3.  **Model Evaluation**: Creating a custom **Perplexity** metric to evaluate the quality of the language model.\n",
    "4.  **Text Generation**: Using the trained model for inference, including **Greedy Decoding** and the more advanced **Beam Search**."

    "## 10.1 Processing the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Language modeling is an unsupervised task. The labels are generated from the data itself: the input is a sequence of tokens, and the target is the same sequence, shifted one step to the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: `[ \"The\", \"cat\", \"sat\" ]`\n",
    "**Target**: `[ \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\" ]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.1.3 N-grams\n",
    "\n",
    "A major challenge in language modeling is large vocabulary size. A model that predicts the next *word* might have to choose from 50,000+ possibilities. The book uses **n-grams** (sequences of *n* characters) to solve this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using 2-grams (bigrams), for example, dramatically reduces the vocabulary. The word \"hello\" becomes `[\"he\", \"ll\", \"o\"]` (with padding). This allows the model to handle a much smaller vocabulary and even create words it has never seen before by combining known n-grams."

    "Greedy decoding has a major flaw: it's not optimal. It might pick a word that seems good *now* but leads to a dead end later (e.g., \"the dog was **ru**\" -> \"the dog was **running**\" vs. \"the dog was **ru**\" -> \"the dog was **ru**g\").\n",

    "2.  **Step 2**: For *each* of those 3 sequences, predict the *next* top 3 words. This gives $3 \\times 3 = 9$ candidate sequences.\n",
