## 📖 About the Book

This book is a comprehensive guide divided into two main parts:

1.  **Part I: Machine Learning Foundations** - This part covers all the basic concepts, from your first end-to-end project to various algorithms such as Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, and Ensemble Learning.
2.  **Part II: Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning** - This part focuses on implementing artificial neural networks (ANNs) using Keras and TensorFlow, covering topics such as training deep networks (DNNs), CNNs, RNNs, Autoencoders, and GANs.
