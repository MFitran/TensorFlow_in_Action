## 📖 About the Book

This book is organized into three main parts, taking you from foundational concepts to production-level applications :

1.  **Part I: Foundations of TensorFlow 2 and Deep Learning** - This part focuses on the basics of how TensorFlow works. It covers implementing simple, foundational models like fully connected networks, CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers .
2.  **Part II: Deep Networks in the Real World** - This section applies your foundational knowledge to popular, real-world machine learning tasks. You'll build and improve models for image classification, image segmentation, sentiment analysis, and language modeling .
3.  **Part III: Advanced Deep Networks for Complex Problems** - This part delves into more advanced topics, including complex sequence-to-sequence models, a deeper dive into Transformers (like BERT), using TensorBoard for monitoring, and productionizing ML workflows with TFX and Docker .
